# STDP-based Training for Adversarially Robust Spiking Neural Networks

This repository Contains DSR training code.

## Overview

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained attention due to their energy efficiency and event-driven nature.

## 🧪 Key Findings

## 📌 Notes
* This branch focuses on DSR-based spike representation.

* STDP integration is optional but improves sparsity and robustness.
